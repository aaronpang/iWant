<strong>How it Works:</strong><br>
iWant takes the search term of the user and looks on Yelp for that search term.<br>
It scrapes all the yelp results' websites for the opening and closing times and price rating<br>
It then uses a formula based on diminishing returns taking into account Price, Location, Opening Time, and Rating<br>
It then compares the rating devised by this algorithm and finds the restaurant with the highest score<br>
Returns the location to the user and directions based on the user's location<br>
